# Hospital Management System

This is a web-based **Hospital Management System** built using Django that allows hospital staff to manage patients, appointments, and doctors efficiently. The application includes features for doctors and receptionists, enabling them to handle different aspects of hospital operations, including patient registration, category-wise sorting, and appointment booking.

## Features

1. **Doctor and Receptionist Accounts**
   - Separate login and registration pages for doctors and receptionists.
   - Doctors can view a sorted list of patient registrations by their specialization category.
   - Receptionists can register patients and manage the appointment process.

2. **Patient Registration and Management**
   - Receptionists can register new patients by filling out their information, including age, problem description, and assigned category (such as general medicine, surgery, pediatrics, etc.).
   - A dynamic registration list for receptionists to manage patient entries.

3. **Category-based Viewing**
   - Doctors can filter and view patient registrations by category (e.g., Orthopedics, Neurology).
   - A clean, card-based design to display patient categories for easy selection.

4. **Appointment Booking**
   - Patients can book appointments online.
   - Doctors can view appointments based on their specialty.

5. **Admin Functionality**
   - Django's built-in admin interface allows for easy management of all the data, including users, patients, and appointments.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Django (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap for responsive design
- **Database**: SQLite (default Django database)
- **Authentication**: Django's built-in authentication system

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/hospital-management-system.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd hospital-management-system
   ```

3. Install dependencies using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Apply database migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. Create a superuser (admin) account:
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

7. Access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Usage

1. **Doctor Workflow**
   - After registering, doctors can log in to view patient registrations filtered by their specialization category.
   - Doctors can select a category using the card-based UI and view patient details.
   
2. **Receptionist Workflow**
   - Receptionists can register new patients, selecting the appropriate category.
   - After registering a patient, the receptionist can manage the appointment list.

3. **Admin Workflow**
   - Admin users can manage doctors, receptionists, patients, and appointments from the Django admin panel.

## Customization

To customize the categories or any functionality:

1. Modify the categories in the `registrations/models.py` file.
2. Customize the frontend templates located in the `templates` folder.

## Future Improvements
